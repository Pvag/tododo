# ToDoDo - the todo list app

## a project by a scared, young, naive _Slurmenton_ and **Pvag**

This is going to become a todo list with persistend data in a MySQL db.

The app is rendered on the server by _php_, with nice touch added frontside
by _js_.

_Tailwind_ is in place, helping with the styling of the app.

## How to run

1. run mamp
2. `npm run dev`
3. visit http://localhost:3000/tododo

The project is served in your browser, watching changes to source files.

### Personalisation

Remember to change ports and urls, locally.
